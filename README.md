# Cleartext API

A small, high-performance API built with FastAPI for language-related tasks like summarization, rewriting, and language detection. The goal is to provide a secure, async-first, and extensible service that interacts with a large language model (Google Gemini) in a clean and scalable way.

## ðŸš§ Work In Progress

This project is being developed as part of a backend coding test. It reflects best practices around structure, security, and maintainability â€” while staying within a focused scope.

## âœ… Goals

- [x] Async FastAPI app with strong typing
- [x] OpenAPI documentation via `/docs`
- [x] Environment-based configuration with `.env`
- [x] Rate limiting and basic security measures
- [ ] Endpoints for:
  - [ ] `/summarize`
  - [ ] `/rewrite`
  - [ ] `/title`
  - [ ] `/language-detect`
- [ ] Unit tests for endpoints
- [ ] Dockerfile for deployment
- [ ] Reflection of tech choices

## ðŸ“¦ Stack

- FastAPI (async + type-safe)
- Python 3.11
- Google Generative AI (Gemini)
- `langdetect` for language classification
- `slowapi` for rate limiting
- `uv` for fast dependency and virtualenv management
